# GCI-Code
A repository to collect code for our GCI project. 

RSA_Optimized.py is a complete RSA program that runs in optimal time and is what is used in the real world. Trying to crrack it will take nearly 300 trillion years!
The rest of the files are used to demonstrate the different aspects of the program. RSA.py is the main program and uses other files to run the code. Look at those for a more detailed explanation of each step.
